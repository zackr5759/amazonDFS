# amazonDFS
This project attempts to fill a chess board with as many "amazons" (queens that can also move like knights) without any of them attacking eachother as possible by exploring each combination of placements with a DFS. It returns true if it could find a solution that has N - K amazons placed. N being the column and width dimensions of the board and K being the amazons that are already placed on the board. Or in other words, 8 amazons for an 8x8 board would return true. 7 amazons for an 8x8 board would return false. Always returns the maximum amount of amazons able to be placed regardless of true or false result.
